| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ADB_ALLOWED_CONNECTION_TIME` | `"adb_allowed_connection_time"` | When the user first connects their device to a system a prompt is displayed to allow the adb connection with an option to 'Always allow' connections from this system. If the user selects this always allow option then the connection time is stored for the system. This setting is the time in ms within which a subsequent connection from an always allowed system is allowed to reconnect without user interaction. Type: long | `@Readable` |
| `AMBIENT_PLUGGED_TIMEOUT_MIN` | `"ambient_plugged_timeout_min"` | The timeout duration in minutes of ambient mode when plugged in. | `@Readable` |

| `AUTO_BEDTIME_MODE` | `"auto_bedtime_mode"` | Whether the Auto Bedtime Mode experience is enabled. | `Standard` |
| `AUTO_TIME` | `"auto_time"` | Value to specify if the device's UTC system clock should be set automatically, e.g. using telephony signals like NITZ, or other sources like GNSS or NTP. Prefer {@code android.app.time.TimeManager} API calls to determine the state of automatic time detection instead of directly observing this setting as it may be ignored by the time_detector service under various conditions. 1=yes, 0=no (manual) | `@Readable` |
| `AUTO_TIME_ZONE` | `"auto_time_zone"` | Value to specify if the device's time zone system property should be set automatically, e.g. using telephony signals like MCC and NITZ, or other mechanisms like the location. Prefer {@code android.app.time.TimeManager} API calls to determine the state of automatic time zone detection instead of directly observing this setting as it may be ignored by the time_zone_detector service under various conditions. 1=yes, 0=no (manual). | `@Readable` |
| `AUTO_TIME_ZONE_EXPLICIT` | `"auto_time_zone_explicit"` | Records whether an explicit preference for {@link #AUTO_TIME_ZONE} has been expressed instead of the current value being the default.

Since {@link #AUTO_TIME_ZONE} can be altered by components besides the system server, and not just via the time_zone_detector logic that sets this value, this isn't guaranteed to be set when the device diverges from the default in all cases. Important AOSP system components like SettingsUI do use the time_zone_detector APIs. 1="has been set explicitly" | `Standard` |
